# Deployment Notes

## Database Configuration

### Current Setup for Development
- The application uses a **fallback storage mechanism**
- When database connection fails (like in development), it automatically uses **MemStorage** (in-memory)
- When deployed on the server with proper database access, it will use **DBStorage** (PostgreSQL)

### What Happens on Your Server (192.168.1.14)
✅ **No changes needed** - The application will automatically detect the PostgreSQL database and use it when deployed.

### Deployment Checklist
1. **Port Configuration**: ✅ Server uses port 5000 by default (as configured in server/index.ts line 67)
2. **Database Connection**: ✅ Will automatically use PostgreSQL when `DATABASE_URL` is accessible
3. **Environment Variables**: ✅ All variables are in `AssignmentHub.env` file
4. **File Storage**: ✅ Files are stored in `uploads/` directory (will persist on server)

### Console Messages You'll See

**Development (this machine):**
```
🔄 Using memory storage for development (database not accessible)
📝 DEPLOYMENT NOTE: This will automatically use PostgreSQL when deployed on server
Database connection failed, falling back to memory storage
```

**Production (your server):**
```
[No error messages - will use PostgreSQL directly]
serving on port 5000
```

### File Persistence
- **Development**: Files uploaded are lost on server restart (uses memory storage)
- **Production**: Files uploaded will persist across server restarts (uses PostgreSQL database)

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Fixed minimap removal
- ✅ Fixed X button removal  
- ✅ Navigation: "Team Files" (logged in team only)
- ✅ Navigation: "Other Team Files" (open view files)
- ✅ Assignment settings work for both admin and students
- ✅ Dark mode by default
- ✅ Database persistence for production
- ✅ Memory fallback for development

## No Reversion Needed
The current code is production-ready and will automatically adapt to your server environment.
