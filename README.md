# AssignmentHub

A streamlined file sharing and presentation system designed to eliminate the common classroom hassles of student presentations.

## üéØ Problem Solved

One of the biggest time-wasters in classroom presentations is the technical setup:

1. **Server Navigation Issues**: Students upload files to IIIT-H servers, then waste time logging in, navigating folders, and finding files during presentations
2. **USB Drive Fumbling**: Students struggle with pen drives, compatibility issues, and file transfers
3. **Laptop Connection Problems**: Time lost connecting personal laptops to projector cables, driver issues, and display problems
